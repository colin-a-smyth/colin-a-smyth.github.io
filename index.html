        <p>This is a plot of a sine curve. It is a sample plot for us to display the way that we can format plots in our datastory. This paragraph serves only as filler test to beef up the page.

        <h2>Background Information on WikiSpeedia</h2>
        <p>
            WikiSpeedia is a game where the player is given a starting Wikipedia article and a finishing Wikipedia article, and the aim is to get from start to finish using as few hyperlinks 
            as possible. You can play the game <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/", target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Data</h2>
        <p>
            The data that we have from the game is as follows:

            <ul class="filename">
                <li>articles.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all navigable articles in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>categories.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>The categorz and sub-categories that each article falls into.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>links.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all links between articles. It should be noted that this set is directed, A -> B does not imply B -> A.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>paths_finished.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all paths that were finished by players in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>paths_unfinished.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all paths that were unfinished by players in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>shortest-path-distance-matrix.txt</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>A matrix containing the shortest distances between all articles.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            We decided to investigate if there was a bias towards certain countries or world regions in both the articles that the game is based on, and subsequently how people played the game.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Here we will put the analysis that Tim and Zaineb did?
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            Here we will put what we can draw from the analysis I suppose?
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            Conclusion information perhaps here to finish it all off...
