        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Wikipedia is a huge database of information with a large range of uses. From reading about every political scandal your favourite
            celebrity has been involved in, to learning about the origins of spaghetti, the information is at your fingertips. This range of 
            data subsequently is proving useful in recent times in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks. Thus,
            any bias in Wikipedia if not handled correctly could prove disastrous for these models.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Wikispeedia is a game built off Wikipedia, in which players are tasked to navigate from one Wikipedia article to another, using
            only the hyperlinks in the articles. The aim is to get to the target article in as few clicks as possible. You can play the game 
            <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/", target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            In this project, we look at the bias in the representation of countries in the Wikispeedia dataset, and if this is then reflected
            in the players' gameplay patterns. We will look at the player's behaviour, to see if it is a reflection of the bias already 
            existing in the dataset, or if it takes a different or more extreme bias. A bias in a dataset such as Wikipedia would be 
            detrimental to all new models that are being trained on it, and additionally is detrimental for the population trying to gather 
            objective information from a source that is inherently biased.

<!--             Wikipedia is a minefield of information. 

            Wikipedia is a source for many LLM models, accessible format. 
            Wikipedia is editable by anyone, and is accessible by anyone.
            This of course brings up the question of wether this information is biased. 
            More specifically, if it is biased based on country and continent.

        <h2>The Data</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The data that we have from the game is as follows:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="filename">articles.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all navigable articles in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">categories.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>The category and sub-categories that each article falls into.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">links.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all links between articles. It should be noted that this set is directed, A -> B does not imply B -> A.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">paths_finished.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all paths that were finished by players in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">paths_unfinished.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all paths that were unfinished by players in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">shortest-path-distance-matrix.txt</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>A matrix containing the shortest distances between all articles.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">
            We decided to investigate if there was a representation bias towards certain countries or world regions in both the articles that the game is based on, and subsequently how people played the game. Our analysis looks at the following aspects of a countries representation:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Article Length</b>: The number of words in each article.</li>
                <li><b>In-/Out-degree</b>: The number of links into and out of an article.</li>
                <li><b>Sentiment of the article</b>: How positive or negative the language used in an article is.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
    <h3>What countries are in our dataset?</h3>
    
        <p class="text-justify">
            In this project, we followed the country classifications as outlined <a href="https://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/Classifications.html">by the UN</a>. These countries can be seen in the map below.
        </p>
        
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/16189366">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js">
            </script>
        </div>
       
        <p class="text-justify">
            The map can be viewed separated by either the regions used in our analysis, or by the economic regions outlined by the UN. Of course it is known that certain countries have huge populations compared to others, and that there is serious economic disparity throughout the world. It is also not a secret that Western countries have a tendancy to consider themselves as ***.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The bar chart below shows us that countries are almost uniformly distributed in each income band, with a slightly higher
            number of high-income countries.
        </p>
        
        <div class=plot>
            {% include percentage_economic_classification.html %}
        </div>

    <h2>Let's have a closer look at the articles!</h2>
        <h3>Article lengths</h3>
        <!-- if possible combine the two plot using dropdown -->
        <div class=plot>
            {% include article_length_region.html %}
        </div>
        <div class=plot>
            {% include article_length_economic.html %}
        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The articles describing the countries of the world vary greatly in their lengths. We see countries such as Argentina, Peru and Spain with articles of more than 70,000 words, and conversely countries such as Martinique and Anguilla with less than 8,000 words. Indeed, this would make sense if the lengths of articles corresponded to something inherent to the country such as population or area, however we can see that there is a tendency for high-income countries to have longer articles than their lower-income  counterparts. This disparity is something to note, as it may reflect a blatant bias from the outset, however this is an important fact to consider when we are looking at the number of hyperlinks each article has. Of course, we would expect a longer article to have more hyperlinks, however is this always the case?
        </p>
        
    <h3>Hyperlinks: a key ingredient to be well connected to the network of articles</h3>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/16240503">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js">
            </script>
        </div>
        
        <h3>A neutral tone ?</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Wikipedia aims to keep a neural point of view (NPOV) across all of its articles. In order to test this claim across the articles describing countries, we ran a sentiment analysis model across each article. Rankings were given between -1 and 1, with -1 being certainly negative and 1 being certainly positive.
        </p>
        <!-- sentiment analysis -->
        <p class="text-justify">
            All country articles received a sentiment score of between -0.2 and 0.2, which would suggest that these articles are meeting the NPOV criteria of Wikipedia. Great news!
        </p>
        
        <!-- if possible combine using dropdown -->
        <div class=plot>
            {% include sentiment_economic_std.html %}
        </div>
        <div class=plot>
            {% include sentiment_region_std.html %}
        </div>
        
        <p class="text-justify">
            There is however a slight disparity present when we look at the aggregated sentiment scores based on geographical region. Here, we can see a disparity between regions such as Australia and New Zealand and *******. This could suggest that there are certain regions of the world that are portrayed in a more positive light than others. We do have to consider however that some countries may just have a more negative history, whether through colonisation, war, famine or any other range of things, which will in turn reduce their sentiment score, even from a neutral standpoint.
        </p>
        

    <h2>Ok, so the data has some inherent biases, but how do they manifest in how people play the game? </h2>
        <h3>Finished vs unfinished paths</h3>
        
        <div class=plot>
            {% include finished_unfinished_region.html %}
        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The region which sees the largest number of paths finished is Northern America, but this is not exactly a shock. We have seen the in- and out- degree of the United States of America is huge. The likelihood of finding something connected to your target in that article is quite high. It is more interesting to see that paths starting with countries in Micronesia and Polynesia have much less finished paths than their “western” counterparts.
        </p>

        <h2>What really impacts the biases ?</h2>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The presence of biases in Wikipedia, such as gender biases that underrepresent women and perpetuate stereotypes, poses risks. These biases can distort public knowledge and, potentially, be significantly magnified by LLMs<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. In addition to gender bias, biases related to ethnicity and race are among others notable societal issues<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Initially, our research aimed to categorize individuals with a Wikipedia article by ethnicity, to perform similar analysis done 
            on gender.However, we encountered significant technical and ethical challenges. The fluidity of ethnic groups and the personal 
            nature of ethnic identity make accurate classification difficult, increasing the likelihood of errors. A particular ethical
            dilemma arose from the potential misuse of findings: if our flawed ethnicity-based analysis suggested an absence of racial bias in 
            Wikipedia,such results could be erroneously exploited to downplay the seriousness of ethnic discrimination on the platform<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            To navigate these complexities, we refocused our research on examining country representation within Wikipedia. This approach helps
            identify biases in the dataset and user navigation patterns. We hypothesize that analyzing representation by country can indirectly
            reveal racial biases. It's important to note that underrepresentation of certain countries does not necessarily indicate 
            intentional racism by Wikipedia contributors. Rather, it may reflect systemic disparities, where countries with lower financial 
            resources, often non-western, are less represented. By shifting our research question, we aim to mitigate the ethical risks 
            associated with misinterpreting data on racial discrimination, opting for an inquiry that is more ethically sound. </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Dataset is biassed towards high income countries and against places like Micronesia and Polynesia.
            This dataset could work for an LLM for the US but not for other regions, should be considered before training a model!
