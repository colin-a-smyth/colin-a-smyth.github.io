        <h2>Background Information on WikiSpeedia</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Wikipedia is a huge database of information with a large range of uses. From reading about every political scandal 
            your favourite celebrity has been involved in, to learning about the origins of spaghetti, the information is at your 
            fingertips. This range of data subsequently is proving useful in recent times in the training of Large Language Models 
            (LLMs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, any bias in Wikipedia if not handled correctly could prove disastrous for these models.

            Wikispeedia is a game built off Wikipedia, in which players are tasked to navigate from one Wikipedia article to another, 
            using only the hyperlinks in the articles. The aim is to get to the target article in as few clicks as possible. 
            In this project, we look at the bias in the representation of countries in the Wikispeedia dataset, and if this is then 
            reflected in the players' gameplay patterns. We will look at the player's behaviour, to see if it is a reflection of the bias 
            already existing in the dataset, or if it takes a different or more extreme bias.

            A bias in a dataset such as Wikipedia would be detrimental to all new models that are being trained on this dataset, and 
            additionally is detrimental for the population trying to gather objective information from a source that is inherently biased.

<!--             Wikipedia is a minefield of information. 

            Wikipedia is a source for many LLM models, accessible format. 
            Wikipedia is editable by anyone, and is accessible by anyone.
            This of course brings up the question of wether this information is biased. 
            More specifically, if it is biased based on country and continent.

            WikiSpeedia is a game where the player is given a starting Wikipedia article and a finishing Wikipedia article, 
            and the aim is to get from start to finish using as few hyperlinks as possible. You can play the game

            We will look at the player's behaviour, to see if it is a reflection of the bias already existing in the dataset, 
            or if it takes a different or more extreme bias.

        <h2>The Data</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The data that we have from the game is as follows:

            <ul>
                <li class="filename">articles.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all navigable articles in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">categories.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>The category and sub-categories that each article falls into.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">links.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all links between articles. It should be noted that this set is directed, A -> B does not imply B -> A.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">paths_finished.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all paths that were finished by players in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">paths_unfinished.tsv</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>Containing all paths that were unfinished by players in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="filename">shortest-path-distance-matrix.txt</li>
                <ul class="filedescription">
                    <li>A matrix containing the shortest distances between all articles.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            We decided to investigate if there was a bias towards certain countries or world regions in both the articles that the game is based on, and subsequently how people played the game.

        <h2>Analysis of the Wikipedia Articles</h2>
        <p>
            Here we will put the analysis that Tim and Zaineb did?
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            Here we will put what we can draw from the analysis I suppose?
